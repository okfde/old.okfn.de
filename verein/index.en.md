## Goals

The Open Knowledge Foundation Germany considers itself an active part of German and European civil society. We promote and support civil rights as they are formulated in the German constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights. We campaign in particular for the protection of these rights online.

Open knowledge helps citizens to obtain information and enables informed opinion-making. It generates societal and economic value and is, in our view, indispensable for a functioning democracy. We are striving to make open knowledge an integral component of the modern world, online as well as offline. Open knowledge delivers far-reaching societal change. This includes:

**Better government**: Openness improves governance through increased transparency, efficiency, and participation. We support international efforts such as the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) to engage in this domain.

**Better access to culture**: Openness in the cultural domain means granting citizens access to cultural information and giving them the opportunity to actively engage with it. We support international efforts such as the [Open Glam Initiative](http://openglam.org/) (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) in this area.

**Better research and science**: In order to make research more efficient and to ensure its relevance for society, research results and activities need to be open and transparent. We acknowledge the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org) and the [Berlin Declaration](http://openaccess.mpg.de/Berliner-Erklaerung) and aim to further the Internet's role as a fundamental, global instrument for scientific discovery.

**Better economy**: Openness allows for a simplified and accelerated reutilization of open material, data, and content as the basis for the development of innovation, tools, and services.

[Here we explain](/themen/) in detail how this translates into the focus for our work.

**Based on our conviction, we pursue the following goals**:

* Advancement of unlimited access to knowledge in all branches of societies (politics, culture, economics, science)
* Dissemination of open knowledge and open data as standards
* Advocacy against restriction of knowledge, e.g. legislative

**To reach these goals**:
* we provide technical tools that inform citizens about the potential and chances of open data and empower citizens to become active
* we organize educational events and projects and author publications in the domain of science, research, and public relations
* we offer trainings on open data and related technical tools
* we organize groups that discuss sustainable strategies and applications for the usage and advancement of open knowledge
* we build our community and connect relevant individuals with one another
