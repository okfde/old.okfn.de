# Tell me more…

Its been a big year for open government data. Around the world governments and public bodies have been opening up official datasets for the public to reuse. There has been an explosion of new applications, competitions, hackdays and other initiatives from local authorities, central government departments, international bodies and others. This event will bring together movers and shakers from the world of open government data — including government representatives, policymakers, lawyers, technologists, academics, advocates, citizens, journalists and reusers.

# What will happen?

There will be two days of discussions, drafting, planning and hacking. Crucially we hope to:

  * **Build consensus** around key legal, technical and policy issues related to opening up government information.
  * **Strengthen the community** of people working on different aspects of opening up official data around the world — from both inside and outside government. (Many people working on this area will not have met in person!)
  * **Encourage the exchange of experiences, expertise and ideas** between those involved in leading open government data initiatives in different countries.
  * **Make things!** We hope there will be plenty of space for developers to hack on things — from refining core bits and pieces of technology to rapid prototyping of new ideas.

# What will the format be?

Presentations will be kept to a minimum. Each day will begin with a sprinkling of short talks followed by plenty of time to talk, plan and work on things.

# Can I submit a presentation?

We are going to put out a call for short presentations (around 30 x 10 minute slots) shortly. Details/links will be posted on the [open-government](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-government) discussion list.

# Can I propose a session?

Yes please! Again, we’re going to brainstorm, plan and schedule sessions on the [open-government](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-government) discussion list — so head there if you have any cunning ideas!

# What kinds of topics will be covered?

Possible sessions include:

  * How can we encourage other countries to open up official information?
  * Open government data in law and policy: obstacles and opportunities
  * Promoting reuse: competitions, community engagement, the role of the media
  * Finding open government data: catalogues, registries and metadata
  * Raw Data Now! Technical aspects of opening up government data
  * The role and value of linked data
  * Open government data and data journalism

# What kinds of outputs will there be?

Projected outputs include things like:

  * First draft of an international ‘open data manual’ (organised as a ‘Book Sprint’)
  * A set of key open government data principles
  * A timeline of key developments for open government data around the world
  * A fairly comprehensive list of official initiatives — including data catalogues and competitions
  * A list of key examples of the reuse of open government data
  * Launch of RawDataNow.com — illustrating what we mean by ‘raw data’ aimed at those who publish official information
  * Brainstorming about projects which would make it easier for citizens to find, analyse and visually represent the data they are looking for
