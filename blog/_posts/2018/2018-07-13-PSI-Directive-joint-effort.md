A short update on the PSI directive (the 
proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the re-use of public sector information (recast). 
Today the OKF comment for the PSI directive recast was submitted.

Thanks to OKF international, OKFFI and OKFAT for the combined effort.

More background information and rough timeline of the next steps:

The committee responsible for the PSI Directive is [ITRE](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/itre/home.html), the Industry Committee.

The report is expected towards the end of October, rapporteur is Neoklis Sylikiotis (GUE/NGL). 
(Hint: Anybody from the Greek open data scene is highly welcome to talk to us or Neoklis Sylikiotis.)

ITRE shadow rapporteur*: EPP: Michal Boni, S&D Razvan Popa, ALDE Morten Helveg Petersen, Greens: Reda

IMCO has special competence, which is why it is good to address the shadow rapporteurs*:

EPP Sabine Verheyen, S&D Liisa Jaakonsaari, ECR Richard Sulik, ALDE Dita Charanzova

Timeline in IMCO: Deadline for amendments was today, compromises will be negotiated in September, vote expected 10 or 11 October.

Timeline ITRE: Rapporteur's draft report must be submitted by the end of September, it will be presented publicly on 8 or 9 October, 11 October deadline for amendments, vote on 3 December.

The first talks with the Council could then take place in Strasbourg in week 50.

If the Austrians want to have a good say during their presidency, the Council should also have its "General Approach" ready by calendar week 50, so that the negotiations can start. However, completion is not expected to take place before the end of January under the Romanian Presidency.
