<i>English summary <a href="https://okfn.de/blog/2018/10/PSI-Policy-EUDataSummit#english">below</a></i>.
Seit [2012](/files/blog/2018/10/PSI-Stellungnahme-2012.pdf) besch√§ftigt sich die OKFDE aktiv mit der PSI - Public Sector Information Directive, aka Open Data. Und so wie es scheint, auch noch l√§nger.

Anlassgegeben zu den aktuellen Neuverhandlungen der PSI Richtlinie fand am 24.-26. Oktober
der [EUDataSummit](http://www.kas.de/wf/en/17.78393/) in der KAS Konrad Adenauerstiftung statt.

Den Anfang machte Rufus Pollock zu digitaler Transformation von "Atomen zu Bits".
[Pr√§sentation](/files/blog/2018/10/open-revolution-24-oct-2018-berlin.pdf) hier. Video folgt.

Kurz seine These: Die Rahmenbedingungen der "Digitalisierung" durch "costless copying" f√ºhren zu Marktmachtkonzentration (aka Monopole) welche wiederum zu Verm√∂gensungleichheiten f√ºhren, welche wiederum zu politischen Herausforderungen f√ºhren
(siehe Trump, Rechtsruck in Europa, Brasilien, ...). Zur Teill√∂sung dieser Herausforderungen schl√§gt er ein Remunerationsystem
bei Patenten, ... vor. ([Buch Kapitel 10](https://openrevolution.net/)).

Danach gab eine Podiumsdiskussion. Eines der Highlights war der sehenswerte √úberblick von der PSI Genese in Europa aus Br√ºsseler Sicht von Malte Beyer. [Exakter Beginn](https://youtu.be/qz9BC35gkxU?t=1194) vom Video:

Malte Beyer verkn√ºpfte dabei den Bogen von [2008 Paper von Rufus](https://rufuspollock.com/2008/03/12/models-of-public-sector-information-provision-via-trading-funds-report-published-today/) zu den aktuellen franz√∂sischen Rahmenbedingungen. (Als Beispiel nannte er die Kostenbefreiung des nationalen franz√∂sischen Geographiedienstes und der Daten und die Kostenabdeckung durch zuk√ºnfigte Mehrwertsteuer die aus jenen Anwendungen enstehen).
Industriepolitik. Wirtschaftspolitik. Anreizsysteme.
(Text siehe Transkript im englischen Teil).

Urspr√ºnglicher Antreiber war UK. Fehlt jetzt weg. Franzosen aktuell der zweite Treiber.

Und es ist ein Frage des politischen Willen.

*cough* *cough* oder wie man auf Deutsch sagt *HUESTEL*!!!

Das zweite Panel behandelte "B2B and B2G Data Sharing". Video folgt.

Nach den Breakfast Session "Data Driven Governments" und "Access to Data" kamen in der extra einber√§umten PSI Policy-Lunch-Session Mitglieder der aktuellen √∂sterr. EU-Pr√§sidentschaft, EC, Verhandlungsteam der einzelnen L√§nder, Open Data Enthusiasten und Wirtschaftsleute zusammen. Und es fand ein √§ussert reger Austausch statt (quasi opengov).

Wir werden sehen wie s√º√ü oder sauer die n√§chste PSI wird.

Danke an allen beteiligten Personen, vorallem jene die extra nach Berlin kamen.
Danke an Pencho und KAS Stiftung, oder wie es Mathias Schindler so treffend sagte.

### English

Transcript of [Malte Beyer](https://youtu.be/qz9BC35gkxU?t=1194) (status: machine translated)

Thanks for for having me, I'm first and
foremost a true soldier I mean in the
bureaucracy you're never and an agenda
set at the lowest level it's coming from
higher moments and I'm have a great team
what doing open data since it's
deception and I think that term public
sector information we owe to the Brits
it's their fault obviously who we're the
the true innovators on this front in the
Late 1990s and early 2000s when the
further where the policy was basically
created with the original directive in
2003 and when I joined the Commission in
2011 my German friends lawyer friends
were saying we're gonna go work on and
say yeah it's open data what's that? yeah
IWG Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz
ah this niche law that I've never really
know where to find it which in 2011 was
really for good reasons, a niche law
because it was basically a very soft
along almost powerless almost a
toothless tool in terms of the open data
so over time and that should but we try
to adopt the term open data which
synchronizes maybe more with the 2013
version of the director so the first
revised directive and that's also the
standard label we now try to give it
well we can change the name of the
directive in this round I'm not so sure
but there have been I think suggestions
and we also discusses and it seems that
wear label it but that has all sorts of
complications I think what the
directive had to do and will continue to
have to do is to do it in partnership
with member states we will just now see
again a new report and subsidiarity and
proportionality coming out and there
will be communication from the
Commission on that there was a was a
specific process to underpin this and we
have been reminded of these principles
that are in the treaties in the annexes
to the treaties that you shouldn't try
to regulate everything at European level
and the access freedom of information is
national competence and it will remain
one and that's always been a bit of the
the thing that the openness relies on
the two legs access and reuse as you say
so so certain certain purposes and also
you can see it also in the amendments in
the European Parliament are driven by
transparency I want to know, journalists
want to know activists want to know the
gender pay gap is is a fantastic example
for that people want to know this
because we want to be more transparent
in the world we live in the original
directive however had to find a legal
base in the treaties and that was the
internal market competence with you
saying there's an economic activity that
builds on data and that gives us the
right to say certain things about
conditions that may be or not may not be
attached to data held by the government
then it comes to the restrictions and so
how open have do you have
so with the the idea of of now sitting
together with the members is in a
process still to be defined and I've
been in kind of an act still to have a
specific nature and the process comes
with nature of the act and the influence
and the powers that that now gather that
list that that is something what we try
to break it and we've been involved also
in the g8 Open Data charted in 2013 we
look having at office in the UK again
the Brits at fault here the cabinet did
a marvelous job in setting together that
list of the categories of high-value
data sets in the g8 open data chart at
the international data charter has taken
that over and and has tried to
internationalize from eight countries to
a lot more and now we want to build on
that momentum and say yes we all agree
that certain categories are particularly
valuable. a second driver in that process
is is France it's the law on the digital
Republic which has established a
category of "donate the reference" certain
data assets that are mostly held by the
public sector which have such a core
value in anything that you want to do
and a classic example is 
geospatial information mapping
information all the geo localized
services that you have on your phone
only work with accurate mapping
information otherwise it's crap
so who holds access to that
infrastructure the mapping information
and how has it been usable and reusable
if it has such an important value on you
or all your phones and what do people
have to pay to whom if at all to have
the right to use mapping information and
why is Google so successful in getting
its maps out, maybe because the license
model is better and I mean Rufus no
worries now I mean he's been been
fighting with the UK ordnance service
for years, I'm intellectually speaking
fighting, saying change your yoga
business model and France will do that
trick France will say we will stop the
asset you national Geographic
the charging people to use mapping
information and will replace it with
government funding just to stop it and
hoping to recap on the value that we is
generated by the services using the apps
so the VAT that is paid by the app
developer, the income tax that is paid by
the app developer, that's that's Rufus's
case from 2008 which still is the most
valuable piece to underpin our policy
but it's not that intellectual
discourse is not finished and we've seen
this with reopening the discussion on
the psi directive we're seeing it very
clearly and we're seeing especially
because we want to say that the list of
high value data sets should come free
free at no cost to the user because of
the high value that's the French example
in French say well demonstrate that they
have if there's political will you can
do it and then you try to to tax the app
developers and to get the VAT from them
don't try to have these 8-10 distributors
that happen to be tapped into your
company register in your country and
that basically bring you back the money
that it took to set up the the
infrastructure because there was a cost
of setting up the company register
there's not for a operational cost of having
the company residues running now the
third marginal cost if you want also for
the last copy them will never be closed
and never entirely zero there will
always be a little cost so wrapping this
up open data open government data is an
essential element of anything that we
hear about data than your oil in the new
economy because it's one part of the
data and if you push it now data is data
essential resource in the economy and
will may become that in the second panel
if we agree that at least some data
assets are an essential assets in a data
economy and if it happens to be so that
such as it's operated by the government
then this is a clear case for a public
data infrastructure so a public
provision of that data as infrastructure
a last word I mean it's a bit the semantics
discussion is not always easy out also
inside our house because we have data as
infrastructure versus infrastructures
for data so hosting an open data portal
is an infrastructure for data if you
want and so the whole that the semantics
on data as infrastructure are do not
resonate always very well in our circles
and maybe also with you in the audience
but I think the economic argument that
Rufus has eloquently made before and the
pins the fact that it's a it's like an
infrastructural resource in the economy
and certain of that infrastructure needs
to be publicly provided.
